# Time_Series
## Summary
Within my Time Series analysis, I found that the GARCH model returns provided an analysis that forecasted increasing returns. Due to the GARCH analysis I would buy the Yen right now since the Yen returns will increase every year. The Hodrick-Prescott filter also shows that the settle price will increase over time even though there are smaller increases and decreases. I am confident about the GARCH model, I would not feel confident using the ARMA and ARIMA models for trading. The ARMA model in particular shows that when the lag increases the p value increases and the model becomes less of a good fit for the data. The ARIMA model shows that it is a better fit when compared to the ARMA model. The ARIMA model increases in its ability to fit the data after 5 lags. You can test this by increasing the number of auto regression lags to see if the p value lowers < 0.05.

Within the Regression analysis we look at the historical returns for the settle prices and compare them to the lagged returns. The data is split up between everything up to 2017 and data data from 2018 and beyond. A linear regression is done to fit the split datasets to the model. Predictions are run on that model, resulting in actual and predicted results. The root mean square error (rmse) was taken for the out-of-sample (test) and in-sample(training) data. The out-of-sample data performed better than the in-sample data (training data), resulting in a lower rmse.
